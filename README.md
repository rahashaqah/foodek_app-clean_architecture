# Foodek

## Main TouchPoints
- Mock responses were implemented in several pages to simulate API behavior
- Widgets are split into two categories:
  - Widgets that only used in one page are implemented as methods in the page itself
  - Widgets that are used in several pages are implemented as separate classes in the widgets directory
- Most colors are implemented from the appColors class to ensure easy changes
- All screens are responsive to screen sizes using extension.dart & responsive.dart custom classes


## Design Recommendations
- Our custom Navigation Bar ensures functionality and is more aesthetically pleasing
- Tabs in history & cart screen are center aligned to look better
- Banner in Home Screen navigates automatically each 3 seconds


## Additional Notes
- Background images in Cart Screen & Home Screen Banner are not implemented as the extraction from Figma is not possible
